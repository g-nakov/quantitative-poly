Basic constructions on quantitative containers and quantitative polynomial functors, formalised in Idris2.

The main files are:
 - `QCont.idr` - results on quantitative containers
 - `QPF.idr`   - partial formalisation of the section on quantitative polynomial functors
 - `Examples.idr` - contains a few examples - lists, natural numbers and binary trees.
  
Checked with Idris 2, [version 0.5.1-9b2811f26](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/tree/9b2811f2630b13f52d034674cd25f8c44f039dd4).
